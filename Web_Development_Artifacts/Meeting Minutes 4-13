Current Status
-step by step text progress displayed in real time while running experiment
-adding nodes by component drop down menu, adding edges by node id's

Next Steps
-send screen capture ASAP
-deleting nodes and edges
-displaying component node information
-selecting/attaching data files in components to be experimented on
  -> editing/specifying parameters and variables of components (see component properties)
-displaying metrics/output at end of experiment
  -> option to click to display on screen
  -> option to export data to file
-plan for implementation transition to graphical drag-drop-connect UI as in main TraceLab
  -> decide on library/API to use, look into implementation in main TraceLab (is it portable?

General
-one week sprints now, try to regularly tag/release versions for review by Denys and Carlos
-presentation likely on Friday, April 27
-final deliverable due May 10
