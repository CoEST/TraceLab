Talked about implementation progress.
Evaluated understanding of backend (~50%)
How long until basic experiments can run with step through for user? (maybe 2 weeks)
Once this is done send screen cast to Denys and Carlos for checking.

Upcoming work:
Andrew is going to create a frame for the different types of nodes we want to be able to add. The work can then be partitioned between Andrew and Brian.
We will then work on adding the functionality for specific node types.
Also write up test cases for what we've implemented thus far.
