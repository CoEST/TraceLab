To get the source to compile / run you need the following assemblies:-

Microsoft.TeamFoundation.Client.dll
Microsoft.TeamFoundation.Common.dll
Microsoft.TeamFoundation.Common.Library.dll
Microsoft.TeamFoundation.dll
Microsoft.TeamFoundation.VersionControl.Client.dll
Microsoft.TeamFoundation.VersionControl.Common.dll
Microsoft.TeamFoundation.VersionControl.Common.Integration.dll
Microsoft.TeamFoundation.WorkItemTracking.Client.Cache.dll
Microsoft.TeamFoundation.WorkItemTracking.Client.DataStore.dll
Microsoft.TeamFoundation.WorkItemTracking.Client.dll
Microsoft.TeamFoundation.WorkItemTracking.Client.Provision.dll
Microsoft.TeamFoundation.WorkItemTracking.Client.QueryLanguage.dll
Microsoft.TeamFoundation.WorkItemTracking.Client.RuleEngine.dll
Microsoft.TeamFoundation.WorkItemTracking.Proxy.dll

These will be in your GAC if you have theam TeamFoundation client installed on your machine
 - otherwise you'll need to copy them from one that does.  If you don't want to install the
Team Foundation Client on your build machine then you must copy the assemblies above into
the CCNET server directory along with the ccnet.vsts.plugin.dll

Good luck.
