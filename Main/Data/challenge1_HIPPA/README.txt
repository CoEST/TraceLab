Experiments should be ready to run.
The only thing that has to be updated are the paths in the importers.
Currently we require absolute paths in the importers.
Change paths to four files to the path on your computer:
C:\PROVIDE_PATH_TO\Stopwords.txt
C:\PROVIDE_PATH_TO\Source-Artifacts-HIPAA_Goal_Model.xml
C:\PROVIDE_PATH_TO\Target-Artifacts-CCHIT.xml
C:\PROVIDE_PATH_TO\AnswerMatrix.txt
