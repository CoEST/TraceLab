Data Transfer to Queue	Once the events in the Ping-Pong buffer have been completely transferred to the TMALI_EVENT_QUEUE, the tamliTask() function must re-arm the hardware to swap the Ping-Pong buffer when ready.  In the event that TMALI does not finish transferring the data from the ping buffer before the pong buffer is full, the DCI Driver will issue an error interrupt, invoking the tmaliDciErrorReportedISR().  In response, the tmaliDciErrorReportedISR() will set an error flag so that the tmaliTask() can recover.  The tmaliDciErrorReportedISR() also gives the semDciWait semaphore to awaken the tmaliTask() even though it is likely already awake, since it is possible that the tmaliTask() has just completed transfer of the data at the time the error occurs.  The error will also be counted in TMALI_HK.  The DCI hardware will discard events until the tmaliTask() function completes the prior transfer, recognizes the error flag, and in response manually forces a Ping-Pong swap and re-enables data acquisition.  This guarantees that only complete frames end up in the Ping-Pong buffer and will be considered for processing.  In normal operation this error should not occur as the TMALI task should be fast enough to retrieve data from the DCI Ping-Pong buffer.  When events can’t be handled fast enough the problem should result in an TMALI queue full condition which is reported as an S_TMALI_QUEUE_FULL error using the ccmErrEnq() mechanism.
