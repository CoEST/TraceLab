Public Functions	This task initializes the TMALI CSC and then continues to read data from the DCI and store it in the TMALI buffer each time the DCI driver signals that data is available in the Ping-Pong buffer.  The availability of data in the DCI Ping-Pong buffer is signaled to the tmaliTask using a semaphore.  Unless a fatal error is detected during initialization this task will never terminate.The specified 3 parameters specify the size of the TMALI queue and the initial parameters for the DCI, if the specified values are outside the allowed range default values will be used.The specified QueueSize is the allocated buffersize (in 4 byte EVENTS), the ring buffer is full when ‘QueueSize-1’ EVENTS are stored in the buffer.
