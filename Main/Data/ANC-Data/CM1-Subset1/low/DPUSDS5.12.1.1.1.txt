Flight Software Initialization	The Command and Control CSC is initialized by spawning the CCM Control Task, ccmCtrlTask(), from the operating system startup task, usrRoot().  After the task is spawned it calls a function, ccmInit(), which creates the error/event queue, instantiates needed semaphores and installs various ISRs.  Finally, it spawns the remaining tasks which comprise the DPU FSW. When the CCM Control Task starts up, it reads DPU configuration startup defaults from the SYSTEM_CONFIG_AREA in EEPROM.  If the SYSTEM_CONFIG_AREA checksum is bad, hard-coded defaults are used.  The CCM Control Task initializes the remaining CSCs by calling the applicable initialization function, or if the CSC has an associated task, by spawning the task using the VxWorks® function, taskSpawn().  When the CCM Control Task initializes a CSC, it passes the startup defaults read from EEPROM as parameters to the task initialization function. In addition to its task initialization activities, ccmInit(), also initializes the command length verification table by calling ccmCmdLengthInit().  The command processor uses the created table to verify expected command lengths for newly received commands.
