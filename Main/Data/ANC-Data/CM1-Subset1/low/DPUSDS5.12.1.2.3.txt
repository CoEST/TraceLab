Control and Monitoring	Every time the CCM Control executes, it calls ccmPerProcess() to handle periodic processing responsibilities.  Such responsibilities include analog to digital conversion updates, DPU task monitoring, ICU heartbeat message production, and watchdog strobe. The ccmHealthChk() function, called by ccmPerProcess() verifies the execution of other tasks by monitoring the amount of time that has elapsed since each task last reported.  Other tasks report their execution to the CCM Control Task by calling the function, ccmTaskReport(), providing their task index.  Each task has an expected execution frequency, and if a task does not execute as expected, an error is reported in DPU housekeeping.  If the Command Dispatch Task fails to report for an extended period, the DPU will execute a reboot, since it is impossible to command the DPU if this task is not executing, otherwise it will strobe the watchdog
