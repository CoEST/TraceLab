Data Transfer to Queue	When the tmaliTransferToQueueISR() ISR is invoked, it gives a semaphore to awaken tmaliTask() that will transfer data to the  queue over the VME bus.  The tmaliTask() uses the read() function in the DCI Driver, which implements a data transfer using a high speed assembly language routine.  Because the TMALI ring buffer is implemented as an array, the tmaliTask() function must first examine the TMALI_EVENT_QUEUE to determine whether the data resident in the DCI buffer can be retrieved using a single read() call, or whether two calls are required in order to correctly handle the wrap-around case at the end of the ring buffer.  In addition, the tmaliTask() function must perform an error check to verify that there is sufficient space to receive the data available in the Ping-Pong buffer.  If there is insufficient space for the complete set of frames, the entire contents of the readable Ping-Pong buffer are discarded and the error S_TMALI_QUEUE_FULL is reported using ‘ccmErrEnq’ mechanism.  Such discarded data constitutes an integral number of CCD frames, since the DCI hardware design ensures that Ping-Pong transitions occur at CCD frame boundaries.  This policy of discarding the newer data supports the scientific viewpoint that events collected right after a burst have more scientific value than events collected later.
