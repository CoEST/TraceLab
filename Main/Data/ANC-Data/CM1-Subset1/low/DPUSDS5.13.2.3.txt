Public Functions	This function sets the frame depth of the Ping-Pong buffers used by the DCI CSC.  The frame depth determines how many frames are read into the selected Ping-Pong buffer before interrupting.  The initial value for the frame depth setting is determined by the parameter provided when starting the tmaliTask.  The maximum value to which the frame depth can be commanded is 64 frames, an attempt to command the frame depth to a value larger than this maximum will result in setting the timeout to the default value of V frames.The actual setting of the frame depth could be delayed by a small amount of time if there is activity on the DCI bus, and is typically changed when the DCI has just reported a frame level reached or timeout condition.  This minimizes the chance of changing the setting while the hardware is close to detecting a frame event.  Changing the frame depth while the DCI CSC is processing data could cause unpredictable results.  When a new ‘tmaliDciFrameDepthSet’ command is send before the previous setting has been activated the new request will overwrite the previous request and the DCI will be commanded to the new value at the first available opportunity.
