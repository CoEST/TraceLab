Command Handling	Commands are dequeued from the Command Queue and executed by the Command Dispatch Task, ccmCmdTask().  This task blocks on a semaphore which is given by ccmCmdEnq(). The ccmCmdTask() wakes on the semaphore and calls ccmCmdProcess() to process waiting commands.  The ccmCmdProcess() function subsequently retrieves waiting commands from the Command Queue and invokes ccmCmdDispatch() to verify the expected length of the command and execute it.  If command echo is enabled, ccmCmdDispatch() will call ccmHkMkCmdEcho() to blindly echo the command back to the ground.  Counts for both rejected and executed commands are maintained. If the command sent to ccmCmdEnq() is either a 1 Hz Clock Time message or an Attitude message from the spacecraft, the command will not be forwarded to the Command Queue, but instead will be executed directly while still in interrupt context.  Attitude messages are forwarded to dpaCommandSend(), while the 1 Hz Clock Time message’s parameters are passed to tisTimeSync() in order to synchronize the current time.  Any other non DPU or spacecraft observatory messages are quietly discarded without reporting an error.In order to guarantee that ccmCmdTask() task reports in with the CCM Control Task periodically in absence of a ground command, the semaphore has a timeout value of 20 seconds.  If the semaphore times out, the task will verify no commands are on the Command Queue, and then report in to the CCM Control Task by calling ccmTaskReport().
