Memory Upload and Download Handling	If more than 65535 bytes need to be uploaded, the upload file must be broken up into multiple smaller files, each less than or equal to 65535 bytes, and then each of the virtual uploads should be sent in series.  Because of the sequence numbers, the DPU FSW can receive individual upload commands out of sequence.  There is no time limit for the accomplishment of a single virtual upload, and so a long upload can continue across ground contacts.  If an upload is in progress, the last sequence number can be sent to the DPU FSW and it will report the list of missing sequence numbers via event number S_ccm_MISSING_SEQNO.  If an upload is in progress and needs to be cancelled, it can be discarded by issuing the D_MEM_DAT_CNCL command.
