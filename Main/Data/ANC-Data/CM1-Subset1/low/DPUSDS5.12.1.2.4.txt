Control and Monitoring	the CCM Control Task also handles memory dump commands.  In the event of a data dump command, the CCM Control Task will break the dump into manageable pieces and dump a small portion at a time, each time the task is awakened.  The purpose of this “deferred” activity is to prevent a large dump from consuming available CPU time by keeping the high-priority CCM Command Dispatch Task busy for an extended period.
