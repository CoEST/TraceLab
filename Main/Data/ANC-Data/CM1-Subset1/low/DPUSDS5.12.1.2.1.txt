Control and Monitoring	the CCM Control Task initializes the DPU FSW. It is the responsibility of the CCM Control Task to establish a successful boot.  It does so by blocking on temporary semaphores, each with a 5 second timeout, after spawning the SCU Interface Task and the CCM Command Task.  If both of these tasks report a successful initialization by giving the semaphore, the CCM Control Task toggles the BC_INDEX parameter in EEPROM to indicate a successful boot.  If either task does not report a successful initialization, the CCM Control Task disables the watchdog strobe to effect a reboot of the DPU.  The rationale for selecting the successful initialization of these two tasks as the definition of a successful boot is that the DPU FSW requires these tasks, as a minimum, to establish ground contact and provide commandability.Once this initialization is complete, the task blocks on a binary semaphore which is given by the SCUI Command ISR upon arrival of the 1 Hz Clock Message.  In the event a Clock Message does not arrive, the semaphore will time out after 1.5 seconds.  The CCM Control Task remains alive to create and transmit DPU housekeeping at the appropriate intervals, perform various periodic processing tasks, and to process memory dump commands.	The final call to ccmErrEnq() is performed in order that if an error occurs in an interrupt service routine, a global variable is set to the value of the errno which is then enqueued into the Error/Event Queue as part of this task’s normal processing.
