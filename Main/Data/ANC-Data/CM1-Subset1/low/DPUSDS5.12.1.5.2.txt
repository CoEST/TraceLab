Error Collection and Reporting	The ccmErrEnq() function tracks the last error reported and its frequency of occurrence.  Once an error code has been reported it becomes the previously reported error code maintained by ccmErrEnq().  A repetition count is then incremented for each subsequent, consecutively reported, identical instance of this previously reported error.  If this error code is reported more than once in one high-rate housekeeping reporting period, then a special error, S_ccm_ERR_REPEAT is enqueued with the repetition count for the error encoded in the least significant byte. This mechanism effectively reduces the potential for housekeeping telemetry to become flooded with a single repeated error.
