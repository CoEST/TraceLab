Ring buffer data structure	The  CSC maintains a FIFO implemented as a ring buffer to temporarily store the data received from the DCI before it is processed. The ring buffer uses two pointers called pIn and pOut to keep track of the data in the buffer. The pointers were defined such that reading from the buffer is the simplest operation and only a single compare is needed to verify if the buffer is empty. The buffer only stores Events so the pointers point to these four byte entities. As the DCI specifies all data in bytes, sizes have to be converted before reading data.
