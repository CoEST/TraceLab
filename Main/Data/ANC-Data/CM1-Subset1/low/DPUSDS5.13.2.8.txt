Public Functions	This function returns the next EVENT in the queue to the caller.  The caller should store the value returned by this function in a variable defined locally within the scope of the function from which it is called.  If the return value is stored as described above, the EVENT value is stored in a RAD6000 register rather than memory.  Processing is therefore much faster since register accesses on the RAD6000 are much faster than memory accesses.A compilation option ‘TMALI_NOCHECKS’ is provided for the disabling of buffer empty checks. This results in slightly faster code but should only be used when the application using this function is known to make proper calls to the function.  If the TMALI module is compiled with the ‘TMALI_NOCHECKS’ option an improper call to the tmaliNextEvent function (calling it when no data is available in the TMALI buffer) will compromise the TMALI buffer data structure.The queue structure and the related pointers are described in the local ‘tmaliP.h’ header file. As only the write pointer (pOut) is manipulated here and the operations on the 32 bit pointers themselves are 'atomic' no mutual exclusion problem can occur.
