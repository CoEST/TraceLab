Memory Upload and Download Handling 	The command D_MEM_BLK_DNLD is used to download data from a file contained in the EEPROM filesystem.  As in the upload command, only the block number need be provided, and the entire contents of the filename formed from the block number will be downloaded.  To download data from any location other than the EEPROM filesystem, the command D_MEM_DAT_DNLD is used.  As described previously, downloads handled in a deferred fashion to avoid consuming excessive CPU time.  A single “virtual” download will appear on the ground as a series of download packets, the contents of which must be extracted and concatenated in order to recreated the original data sequence.
