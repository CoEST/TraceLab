Error Collection and Reporting	The S_ccm_ERR_REPEAT error encodes the count of the last repeated error in its low order byte.  If a new error is reported as discussed above, ccmErrEnq() will enqueue a S_ccm_ERR_REPEAT  for any previously repeated error, along with the newly reported error.   In order to keep the original error codes and their repeated counts together in the same error packet, ccmMkHkErr(), enqueues a special error code, S_ccm_ERRQ_FLUSH, as a special signal to ccmErrEnq() that it needs to clear its error tracking mechanism and enqueue any  repeated error counts associated with a particular error.
