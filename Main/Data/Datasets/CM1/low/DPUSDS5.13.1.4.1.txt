Event Retrieval From Queue	Events are retrieved from the TMALI_EVENT_QUEUE by the DPA CSC via an API consisting of two functions: tmaliWait() and tmaliNextEvent().  For efficiency, the following API usage points are relevant:* The DPA CSC will “inline” the tmaliNextEvent() function in order to avoid a function call for each event,* The DPA CSC will place each event received into a register, and complete the processing for a given event while resident in a register before retrieving the next event, and* The tmaliNextEvent() function performs no error checking in order to maximize the efficiency of the function.  Therefore, the DPA CSC must keep track of the number of events retrieved versus the number provided in return from tmaliWait().
