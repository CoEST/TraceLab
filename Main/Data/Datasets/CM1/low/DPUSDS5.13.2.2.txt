Public Functions	This function gets the frame depth of the Ping-Pong buffers used by the DCI CSC.  The frame depth determines how many frames are read into the selected Ping-Pong buffer before interrupting.  The initial value for the frame depth setting is determined by the parameter provided when stating the tmaliTask.  The returned value is the current active value, this may differ from the last commanded value as the commanded value only takes effect when data is transferred from the hardware Ping-Pong buffer to the TMALI queue (in response to a frame or timeout interrupt, see section 5.13.2.3).
