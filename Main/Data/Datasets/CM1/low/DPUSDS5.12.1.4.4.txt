Memory Upload and Download Handling	Data can be upload to several types of locations, including* DRAM* EEPROM* hardware registers, and* EEPROM filesystem.ial D_MEM_DAT_UPLD command specify the target location.  If the destination is the EEPROM filesystem, a “block number” is provided in lieu of a memory address , which is used by the DPU FSW to formulate a filename of the form eefs1:DPU_blk.##, where ## is the block number.  In this case, once the entirety of the uploaded data is received by the DPU FSW, the uploaded data is then written to that file in the EEPROM filesystem.  If a file already exists with that name, it is overwritten.  The EEPROM filesystem can be reinitialized using the command D_MEM_DISK_INIT.
