Error Collection and Reporting	At boot time, no error queue exists because it has yet to be created.  Errors that occur in this early stage of error reporting are assigned directly to the global task variable errno.  The reader may refer to the VxWorks® Programmer’s Guide, section 2.3.7 for more information on errno.  If errno is set after the error queues are created, it is queued to the Error Queue by calling ccmErrEnq().
