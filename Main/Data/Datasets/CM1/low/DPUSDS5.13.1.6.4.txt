Setting Data Timeout in DCI	During nominal operation, frames arrive approximately every 11 msecs.  The DCI hardware will generate an interrupt if event data has been received in one of the Ping-Pong buffers, and a configurable amount of time has passed during which no additional events have been received.  A data timeout interrupt is not an error, but rather typically indicates that the current exposure has been completed.  The data timeout interrupt allows the TMALI CSC to retrieve the “trailing” events from the DCI Ping-Pong buffer.  The function tmaliDciTimeoutSet() provides an API to the DCI Driver to allow the timeout setting to be altered.
