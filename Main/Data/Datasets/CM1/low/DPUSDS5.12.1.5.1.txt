Error Collection and Reporting	The DPU-CCM CSC provides a centralized error reporting interface, ccmErrEnq(), that other FSW tasks use to report errors.  Each time it wakes, ccmTask() checks to see if it is time to form an error/event packet for transmission to the ground.  If so, ccmTask() calls ccmHkMkError() to actually create the packet and forward it to DPU-SCUI for transmission to the ground.
