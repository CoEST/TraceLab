Telescope Module Access Library and Interface CSC	The TMALI CSC includes the following components:* A queue, TMALI_EVENT_QUEUE, implemented using a ring buffer, which contains the detector events which have been received over the data capture interface from the DCI Driver, but which have not yet been retrieved by the DPA CSC;* An API which facilitates the retrieval of detector events from the queue by the DPA CSC.  The API consists of the tmaliNextEvent() and tmaliWait() functions.* An set of API functions used by the DPA CSC to configure the DCI interface, including tmaliBitArrangementSet(), tmaliDciFrameDepthGet(), tmaliDciFrameDepthSet(), tmaliDciWindowSet(), tmaliDataTimeoutSet(), and tmaliDataTimeoutGet().* An API housekeeping function, tmaliHkGet(), which gathers  CSC housekeeping data at the request of the Command and Control Task.* The task tmaliTask() and an ISR tmaliTransferToQueueISR() work together via a semaphore to synchronize the transfer of data from the DCI to the  queueAn error handling ISR, tmaliDciErrorReportedISR(), is installed as a hook routine to the DCI Driver, and is used to keep track of the number of errors reported by the DCI driver.
