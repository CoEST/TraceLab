Error Collection and Reporting	In order to insure that error counts are not lost due to rollover, ccmErrEnq(), checks to insure that the count for a given error has not gone above 250 in one high rate housekeeping reporting period.  If the error count exceeds 250 for a particular reporting period, ccmErrEnq() will enqueue S_ccm_ERR_REPEAT error with the current error count and will clear its error tracking mechanism.
