Normal Data Exchange Sequence	The TMALI CSC serves as an intermediate manager of EVENT data supplied by the DCI Driver CSC and eventually delivered to the DPA CSC.  The TMALI CSC waits for notification from the DCI CSC that a frame limit (or data timeout) has been reached in the Ping-Pong buffer indicating the EVENT data is ready to be served to TMALI.   TMALI reads all EVENT data from the DCI and notifies the DCI that it can swap Ping-Pong buffers when ready.   TMALI gives a semaphore to unblock the tmaliWait() call from the DPA.
