Public Functions	This routine gets housekeeping data stored for the TMALI CSC including some DCI parameters and resets the tmali internal counters to zero.  When the caller supplied pointer to a TMALI_HK structure is NIL no data is returned but the tmali internal counters are still reset to zero.Two of the four error counters are updated within an ISR context, this requires a task switch safe implementation of these counters.  Within VxWorks this could be solved using a counting semaphore.  In the TMALI CSC design a faster method was used by using a free running error counter and a careful update of the reported number of errors, using an extra temporary variable.  As the increment and assignment of the 32 bit unsigned integers themselves are ‘atomic’ operations the resulting counters are task safe and no error events are lost.  This means that the sum of the errors reported by the tmaliHkGet() function is equal to the total numbers of errors that occurred, no error reports are lost due to the update of the internal structures.
