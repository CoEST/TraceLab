F1	Users can communicate to another user by making phone calls.~
F2	Occurs when callee picks up the handset, callee’s phone stops ringing, caller’s phone stops playing the ring tone, and audio connection is established between the caller and the callee.~
F3	Caller picks up the phone and must successfully acquire resource~
F4	Phone numbers are 4-digits. 4-digits are collected by the caller process from a Caller through a series of four "digits" signal events within the time limit.~
F5	Caller dials '*11', which toggles on/off that phone's DND setting.~
F6	System automatically searches for the number in the database for the associated IP~
F7	User did not finish entering the phone number within the time limits of the system~
F8	Caller may hangs up before the first digit is pressed, in between any digit pressed, when the call cannot be connected, when the call is connected, or when a call is terminated.~
F9	Resource Manager checks to see if there are available resource left in the system~

F31	System Administrator is able to add user account to the system.~
F32	A unique employee is identified by his/her employee ID.~
F33	The Phone IP Mapping has a list of all Phone IP pairs and a Boolean value indicating whether it's available. The System returns the next available Phone IP pair to the Administrator~
F34	Administrator changes the Phone IP pair status to "Used"~
F35	Status of the account is set to "Active"~
F36	System Administrator is able to cancel a user's phone service.~
F37	A phone number becomes available when the user’s phone service is canceled. The Phone IP pair status is set "Available"~
